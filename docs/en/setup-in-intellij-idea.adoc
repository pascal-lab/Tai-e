Given the Gradle build script, setting up Tai-e in IntelliJ IDEA is easy as explained below.


### Step 0

Download IntelliJ IDEA from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) and install it. We recommend installing a recent version (2021.3 or newer) of IntelliJ IDEA for better support of Java 17.

### Step 1

Start to open a project

> *Note*: If you have already used IntelliJ IDEA, and opened some projects, then you could choose `File > Open…` to open the same dialog for the next step.

### Step 2

Select root directory of Tai-e and click "Open".

### Step 3

IntelliJ IDEA may pop up a dialog asking if you trust the Gradle project. Just click "Trust Project" (Don't worry. Tai-e is benign 😃).

You may wait a moment for importing Tai-e.

### Step 4

Go to `File > Project Structure…`, click "Project SDK", select JDK 17. Next, expand "Language level", select "SDK default" (if the default is just 17) or "17 - Sealed types, always-strict floating-point semantics":

> *Note*: If you have not installed JDK 17 yet, just select `Add SDK > Download JDK…`, and select "17" for "Version", any "Vendor" (usually "Oracle OpenJDK"), and "Location" to be installation location (default is fine), and then click "Download" to start downloading in background:

### Step 5 (optional)

As Tai-e is a Gradle project, IntelliJ IDEA always build and run it with Gradle by default, which makes it a bit slower and always output some annoying Gradle-related messages:

To get rid of these problems, you could use IntelliJ IDEA instead of Gradle to build and run Tai-e. Just go to `File > Settings`, and change the build and run tool from Gradle to IntelliJ IDEA:

### Step 6

To run Tai-e in IntelliJ IDEA, first choose main class of Tai-e and open "Run Configuration":

then configure program arguments as follows:

That's it! If you could finish above steps without any problems, then you have successfully setup Tai-e in IntelliJ IDEA. ヽ(｡◕‿◕｡)ﾉﾟ
